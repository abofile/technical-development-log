## Progress
- Learned about **SSH** and successfully set it up with the Raspberry Pi.

## Notes
- SSH allows secure remote access to the Pi from any device on the same network (or globally if configured).
- This makes it easier to manage the Pi without needing a monitor, keyboard, or mouse attached.
