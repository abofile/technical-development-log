## Progress
- Continued practicing key Python concepts from the past two days, including:
  - `break`, `continue`, and loop control flow.
  - Fibonacci number generation.
  - For loops and while loops with various conditions.
  - Skipping specific values in loops (e.g., multiples of 5).
- Completed the Python assessment test today.

## Notes
- Assessment test covered multiple loop structures, control statements, and number sequence generation.
- Mistakes were mostly in multi-condition loops and while loop increment logic.

### Example Mistake 1 – Skipping multiples of 5
**Incorrect:**
```python
for i in range(1, 101):
    if i % 5 == 0:
        continue
    elif i % 2 == 0:
        print(i)
```
**Issue:** Worked correctly for skipping multiples of 5, but logic flow could be simplified and readability improved.

**Corrected:**
```python
for i in range(1, 101):
    if i % 5 != 0 and i % 2 == 0:
        print(i)
```

### Example Mistake 2 – While loop increment logic
**Incorrect:**
```python
x = 1
while x <= 100:
    print(x * 2)
    x += 1
```
**Issue:** Logic produced correct output but did not match intended problem statement; needed to adjust increment or condition for specific requirements.

**Corrected (example fix):**
```python
x = 1
while x <= 50:
    print(x * 2)
    x += 1
```

## Key Takeaways
- Always check loop conditions to avoid unintended iterations or infinite loops.
- Use combined conditions (`and`, `or`) to simplify logic instead of nesting.
- Ensure that your loop’s increment step matches the problem requirements.
- Fibonacci sequences can be implemented in multiple ways (loops, recursion); practicing both will improve versatility.
