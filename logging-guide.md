## Quick Capture (Daily)

When you don't have time for a full entry:
```markdown
## [Date] Quick Note
- Worked on: [brief description]
- Key learning: [one line]
- Link: [commit/resource]
```

Store in `quick-notes/` and consolidate later.

## Consistency Tips

- Log after your last session of the week/month
- Set a recurring reminder
- 15–30 min is enough — rough notes beat no notes
- Review previous entry first for context
- Use quick capture when busy; resume full logging when possible

**Done is better than perfect.**
