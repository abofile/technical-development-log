# Technical Development Log 📘

This repository serves as a structured log of my ongoing development in programming, systems, and data science. All work here reflects personal study, hands-on practice, and project-building across core computing skills.

## 📌 Objectives

- Build a solid foundation in:
  - Python programming
  - Data handling and automation
  - Version control with Git
  - Linux and command-line tools
- Apply concepts through practice scripts and mini-projects
- Maintain consistent documentation of learning

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

- `/logs/` — Daily or weekly learning notes and progress updates
- `/code/` — Practice scripts, notebooks, and concept demos
- `/projects/` — Larger or polished pieces of work (e.g., tools, analyzers, utilities)

## 🛠️ Tools & Resources

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Git & GitHub
- Free educational content (FreeCodeCamp, Real Python, etc.)
- paid educational content (Udemy, codecadmey, Briliant, etc.)
